## üß† Project Overview

Stock price forecasting is a complex challenge due to the market's volatility and sensitivity to economic, political, and psychological factors. This project addresses the challenge by:

- Forecasting stock prices using **LSTM** and **Transformer** models.
- Simulating autonomous trading decisions using a **DQN-based agentic AI**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Time Series Forecasting** using:
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Transformer-based deep learning models
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Normalization
  - Feature engineering
  - Statistical transformation
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Residual analysis
- **Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot**:
  - DQN agent trained with a reward function combining profit, Sharpe ratio, and holding incentives
  - Uses technical indicators: RSI, volatility, and volume
  - Outperforms buy-and-hold strategy in volatile markets
